# Checks the production settings before the first start and before every update:
#
#   deploy/scripts/preflight.sh [env-file]     default: deploy/.env next to the compose file
#
# It reads the env file without running it (no `source`), prints one line per check and a
# total, and never prints a value. Exit 0 = every check passed, 1 = at least one failed.
#   - the env file exists and only its owner can read it (mode 600 or 400);
#   - no setting of the file is also set in this shell: docker compose would take the shell's
#     value instead of the file's;
#   - BACKUP_DIR is an absolute path to an existing directory OUTSIDE this clone (a fresh clone
#     or a `git clean` must never take the backups with it), owned by root with mode 700 (the
#     backup container writes as root without any capability);
#   - BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS, MYSQL_BINLOG_RETENTION_DAYS, LOG_MAX_SIZE and LOG_MAX_FILES have a
#     valid form (the backup and db services check the first two again when they start);
#     LOG_MAX_FILES is at least 2: Docker's `local` log driver compresses the rotated files and
#     then refuses a single file, so with 1 no container would start;
#   - docker compose renders the production compose with this file, so every required setting
#     is there.
