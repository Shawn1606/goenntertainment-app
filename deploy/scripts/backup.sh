# Nightly backup of the database and the uploads (F-17). Runs as the `backup` service of
# deploy/docker-compose.yml, in the MySQL image (it has bash, mysqldump, gzip, tar, sha256sum and
# GNU find and date; it has no flock, so the lock is a directory).
#
#   backup.sh                       daemon: one run at start, then one every day at 02:30 UTC
#   backup.sh --once                one run now; exit 0 = a complete, verified set was written
#                                   (each run first waits up to about 5 minutes for the database)
#   backup.sh --check               healthcheck: exit 0 when the last run succeeded within 26 hours
#                                   and no run failed since
#   backup.sh --seconds-until-next  the seconds until the next nightly run (BACKUP_NOW, a time in
#                                   UTC such as 2026-01-01T01:00:00Z, replaces the clock: tests)
#
# Each run writes one set into /backups (the operator's BACKUP_DIR):
#   db-<stamp>.sql.gz         a mysqldump of the database (one consistent transaction)
#   uploads-<stamp>.tar.gz    the public uploads and the private media (evidence, stories)
#   SHA256SUMS-<stamp>        the checksums of both
# The set is put together in .partial-<stamp>, checked (gzip -t, the dump's completion line,
# tar -t, the checksums) and only then moved into /backups. Only after that are sets older than
# BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS deleted. A failed run deletes nothing, records .last-failure and exits
# non-zero; the healthcheck then reports the service as unhealthy.
#
# Secrets: the database password reaches mysqldump through an option file in /tmp (a tmpfs),
# written by the shell's builtin printf, so it is on no command line and in no log.
