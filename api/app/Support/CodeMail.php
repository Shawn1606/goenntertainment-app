 * Sends mails that carry a code (two-factor codes, password reset codes), never through the log
 * transport: whoever can read the log could sign in or reset the password with the code (F-09).
 *
 * config/mail.php already defaults to SMTP and has no failover to the log mailer, but MAIL_MAILER
 * (or MAIL_URL) could still name it. So the transport that would really be used is looked at
 * before each code mail: the log transport itself, or a failover or round-robin chain that
 * contains it (Symfony names a chain "failover(smtp://… log)"), and the mail is refused with an
 * exception. The callers treat that like any other failed mail; nothing with the code is logged.
 * A faked mailer in tests (Mail::fake) is not a MailManager and is not checked.
